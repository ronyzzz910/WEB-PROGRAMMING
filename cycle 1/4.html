 <h1><u>Apple Cart</u></h1>  
 <h3>Author:<u>G.B.Shaw</u></h3>  
<p><h4>The Apple Cart, which was completed in December 1928, is a wry political satire by George Bernard Shaw. Its plot concerns a monarch who is assaulted by his elected cabinet. They feel that the king is <i>too</i> meddlesome and threaten to resign if he does not sign an ultimatum, which in effect would strip him of his authority and turn him into a powerless figurehead. Either way, the king would be doomed, without a cabinet or without power; his dilemma is the play's catalyst. What follows is political debate, as many sides 
 and problems are discussed and revealed. Added to the commentary on politics is a brief interlude on marriage and adultery, as well as a scene with an American ambassador mocking full democracy and capitalism. Coupled with Shaw's astute insight and sparkling wit, the play succeeds brilliantly in exposing 'the unreality of both democracy and royalty as our idealists conceive them.' His adept portrayal of Breakages, Limited, offers foresight and perspective into the 'destruction, waste, and disease' brought by <i>private</i> capitalism that are all too topical today.</h4></p>
